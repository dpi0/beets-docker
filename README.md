# Beets Docker

Custom [beets.io](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) Docker image.

The `minimal-v*` image tag is for the simplest possible beets set up with basic plugins.

## How to Use?

```bash
docker compose run --rm beets import "/hdd/Downloads/Music/Album"
```

You can use this sample `compose.yaml` for reference

# PLUGINS
plugins:
  # - autobpm # Calc the BPM of a track (needs librosa and completey new and heavy docker image)
  # - chroma # Does Audio Fingerprinting to match files by sound. Useful when filesnames are wrong/bad metadata
  - embedart # Embeds album artwork directly into audio files’ metadata
  - fetchart # Locates album artwork
  - fromfilename # Uses the filename for additional info about the track if not enough metadata is present
  # - ftintitle # Moves “featured” artists from the artist field to the title field
  - lastgenre # Additional metadata using Last.fm
  # - lyrics # Adds only embedded lyrics to the track
  - musicbrainz # Primary metadata authority
  - scrub # Removes all metadata before beets works on the files (prevents prev bad metadata leaks)
  # - smartplaylist # Create .m3u files for playlists
  - zero # Removes certain metadata (scrub was meant to remove all before import, but it doesn't work reliably imo)
  # - bpmanalyser
